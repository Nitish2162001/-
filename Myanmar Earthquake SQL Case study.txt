1. Categorize Countries Based on Aid Level ?

SELECT 
    country_or_org,
    pledged_amount_usd,
    CASE 
        WHEN pledged_amount_usd >= 10000000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN pledged_amount_usd >= 5000000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS aid_level
FROM CountryAid
WHERE pledged_amount_usd IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY pledged_amount_usd DESC;

2.Calculate Percentage Contribution of Each Countryâ€™s Rescue Team ?

SELECT 
    country,
    personnel_count,
    ROUND((personnel_count * 1.0 / t.total) * 100, 2) AS percent_of_total
FROM SearchRescueTeams,
     (SELECT SUM(personnel_count) AS total FROM SearchRescueTeams) t
ORDER BY percent_of_total DESC;

3.Find the Top 5 Countries by Normalized Aid Contribution ?

-- CTE for merging aid and rescue (simulate FULL OUTER JOIN)

WITH Merged AS (
    SELECT 
        a.country_or_org AS country,
        a.pledged_amount_usd AS aid,
        COALESCE(r.personnel_count, 0) AS rescue
    FROM CountryAid a
    LEFT JOIN SearchRescueTeams r ON a.country_or_org = r.country

    UNION

    SELECT 
        r.country,
        COALESCE(a.pledged_amount_usd, 0),
        r.personnel_count
    FROM SearchRescueTeams r
    LEFT JOIN CountryAid a ON a.country_or_org = r.country
),
MaxVals AS (
    SELECT 
        MAX(aid) AS max_aid,
        MAX(rescue) AS max_rescue
    FROM Merged
)

-- Final select with normalized scores

SELECT 
    m.country,
    m.aid,
    m.rescue,
    ROUND(m.aid / NULLIF(mx.max_aid, 0), 2) AS norm_aid,
    ROUND(m.rescue / NULLIF(mx.max_rescue, 0), 2) AS norm_rescue,
    ROUND((m.aid / NULLIF(mx.max_aid, 0) + m.rescue / NULLIF(mx.max_rescue, 0)) / 2, 2) AS final_score
FROM Merged m
JOIN MaxVals mx
ORDER BY final_score DESC
LIMIT 5;


4.Rank Countries by Overall Contribution (aid + rescue)?

SELECT 
    ca.country_or_org AS country,
    COALESCE(ca.pledged_amount_usd, 0) AS pledged_usd,
    COALESCE(sr.personnel_count, 0) AS personnel,
    (COALESCE(ca.pledged_amount_usd, 0) + COALESCE(sr.personnel_count * 10000, 0)) AS contribution_score
FROM CountryAid ca
LEFT JOIN SearchRescueTeams sr
    ON ca.country_or_org = sr.country
ORDER BY contribution_score DESC;
